# Requires an input CSV file with a collumn header of EmailAddress with email addresses of mailboxes to be gathered
# Input CSV file should be in the same folder as the script
# Script will do the following:
# 1. Get the Mailboxes information such as Database and ExchangeGUID
# 2. Retrieve the Store Query information
# 3. Export the Store Query raw data
# 4. Filter and de-duplicat the Store Query data
# 5. Write the Store Query data to the screen
